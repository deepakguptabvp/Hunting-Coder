    "content": "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution. TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript itself includes header files for the DOM and the standard JavaScript library. TypeScript is included as a first-class programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and later, beside C# and other Microsoft languages. An official extension also allows Visual Studio Code to support TypeScript directly and in the JavaScript editor. TypeScript has gained significant adoption in the JavaScript community, especially for large-scale applications. Many popular frameworks and libraries, including Angular, React, and Vue.js, have added TypeScript support.",
